Chapter 353: Shifting Tides (2)



Spreading the news across the continent through long-distance communication had been surprisingly smooth.

The Zhuge Clan’s dedicated efforts, despite their difficult circumstances, and the assistance of the Golden Island Sect demons disguised as Maoshan sorcerers, had played a crucial role.

“To think the Maoshan Sect was this powerful… We were blinded by our arrogance. We were truly frogs in a well.”

The Zhuge Clan Leader sighed, having overestimated their rival’s capabilities… but it wasn’t a bad thing.

It would motivate them to work harder and improve themselves.

‘Of course, this is just the first step.’

Considering Ganghwange’s transportation difficulties, where even traveling between regions required significant time and effort, this was practically a miracle.

But there were still countless obstacles ahead.

Some dismissed the news as a fabrication, refusing to believe it. Others suspected a hidden motive, questioning their intentions. And some were already plotting to exploit the situation for their own gain.

Fortunately, the message had originated from the Zhuge Clan, a renowned and respected family, and its content concerned the Demonic Cult, a common enemy of all factions, regardless of their alignment.

Otherwise, most would have ignored it.

‘Regardless, I’ve succeeded in attracting their attention. Their active cooperation would be ideal, but it doesn’t matter if they don’t believe it right now. I’ve already achieved my objective.’

It was enough for them to be more vigilant, to double-check any suspicious activity, to be more cautious.

It would all become a noose, slowly tightening around the necks of those operating in the shadows.

‘And the Demonic Cult’s notoriety is quite widespread. They’ll be eager to share any information, as long as it doesn’t harm them directly.’

And as expected, it didn’t take long for the situation to develop as planned.

As a result—.

“There have been reports of suspicious activity in the forests near Gaoping, Shanxi Province. Locals reported seeing a large group of people entering the area, and the local sect, the Exquisite Sword Sect, conducted a search but found nothing.”

“The Ironclad Gang in Jiangxi Province has discovered traces of an unknown faction. They found a campsite and pursued the intruders, but they escaped their territory.”

“There have been reports of troop movements at night near the Guiyang Beggars’ Sect branch in Guizhou Province. They’re demanding payment for further information…”

Information from all over the continent began pouring into the Zhuge Clan’s headquarters.

The Zhuge Clan estate, now a bustling center of activity, was functioning as a central control tower, processing and analyzing the incoming data.

‘…This is giving me a headache just by looking at it.’

Hugo, observing the scene from a distance, clicked his tongue.

The tedious task of verifying the information, separating fact from fiction, and categorizing the data…

Even with his enhanced mental abilities and increased processing power, thanks to his boosted stats, he wasn't used to this kind of paperwork.

His other avatars usually delegated such tasks to their capable subordinates, receiving only the finalized reports.

“The report from Jiangxi Province is unreliable. The Ironclad Gang is a small, insignificant sect. There’s no way they could have tracked down a group that’s been meticulously erasing their traces. And why would they leave a campsite behind?”

“We’ve verified the Guizhou report. There were troop movements by the Prince Jing’s army, a local warlord, around the same time. It must have been a misunderstanding.”

But the Zhuge Clan, known for their intelligence and analytical skills, quickly sifted through the information, separating the wheat from the chaff.

They identified and discarded the false reports, the rumors based on misunderstandings, the unreliable intel, and the fabricated stories.

“The Shanxi report seems promising. The location is plausible, and the eyewitness accounts…”

“Ah! There was a similar report from the Jinju Eon Clan in Hebei! And the two locations aren’t that far apart. It’s possible they traveled from Shanxi to Hebei!”

The remaining information, having passed through their rigorous screening process, became valuable data, worth its weight in gold.

The clan’s scholars, renowned for their wisdom and strategic thinking, gathered and began analyzing the most promising leads.

And as the potential routes and destinations were narrowed down,

Hugo’s eyes gleamed as he saw the location at the top of the report.

‘Beijing.’

The former site of the imperial palace, where the Dragon Heart had been located.

A place of great significance.

The other locations on the list were also plausible…

‘…Impressive. They managed to narrow it down this much in just a few days?’

He could now understand why the Zhuge Clan had maintained their prestigious reputation for so long.

He had been slightly dismissive of them before, but now… he was starting to reconsider.

‘I’m… envious.’

Hugo’s eyes sparkled with a newfound respect.

They were truly valuable assets, capable and efficient.

He knew firsthand how much easier it was to manage things with competent subordinates.

The faces of his capable assistants flashed through his mind.

Jin So-ran on Earth, Banshee Queen Olivia, Mula the True Blood vampire, Diana from Hubert’s Trading Company…

And now, he was starting to see the Zhuge Clan members in a new light.

“Young Hero Ha? Are you alright?”

“…Ah! I apologize. I was just… lost in thought.”

He snapped back to reality as he heard his name being called.

He was currently in a meeting with the clan elders, discussing the results of their analysis.

He had to focus.

“It’s understandable. Beijing… How brazen. I never imagined they would return there.”

Qingguan, the Taoist priest from the Maoshan Sect, sighed softly.

Hugo’s presence in this meeting, despite his status as a mere guest, was thanks to him.

He had requested Hugo’s participation, citing his impressive performance at the Shaolin Temple.

‘Of course, he probably hadn’t even heard of me before receiving his mission.’

That’s how connections worked.

But Hugo was qualified to be here.

He was a peak Master Realm expert, after all.

On par with the Zhuge Clan’s strongest warrior.

‘Of course, there are differences in skill and experience within the same realm, so our combat abilities aren’t exactly equal. But a peak Master Realm expert is more than enough to be considered a local hero.’

He was used to interacting with transcendent beings and other powerful figures, so he hadn't realized it before… but in smaller sects and clans, even Master Realm experts were rare, let alone peak Master Realm.

And he was still in his early twenties.

Such treatment wasn’t unusual for a young prodigy with a bright future.

“But it hasn’t been confirmed yet, has it?”

“But it’s the most likely location. It’s not ideal for a ritual, but… Hmm, it depends on the type of ritual they’re planning.”

“Indeed. The Demonic Cult has many unorthodox techniques.”

The discussion continued.

But they all agreed on one thing.

They had to stop the Demonic Cult’s ritual before it was complete.

“…There’s a lot to do. We have to send reconnaissance teams to confirm the location, and we’ll need reinforcements to fight them and rescue the hostages. If the battlefield is Beijing, we’ll need our best warriors. And we’ll need at least three Mysterious Realm experts to deal with the Heavenly Demon…”

“That’s the first problem. They won’t let our scouts return alive. And it’s not just the Heavenly Demon. There’s also Demon Sword Master and the other experts, and the jiangshi…”

They fell silent, their faces grim.

The situation seemed hopeless.

And then,

“I’ll go to Beijing.”

A young man’s voice, clear and confident, echoed through the room.

It was Hugo, who had been silently observing the discussion.

“Time is of the essence. We have to confirm the location as soon as possible. I’m confident I can handle myself in any situation. I’ll go and see for myself.”

His words, a declaration of his willingness to enter the most dangerous and likely location, were met with protests.

It was one thing to participate in a battle, it was another to infiltrate the enemy’s lair alone.

And Beijing was a demonic realm, notorious for disrupting the flow of Ki, making it difficult for martial artists and sorcerers to use their full power.

But Hugo’s resolve was firm, and their protests eventually subsided.

After all, they were the ones whose family member had been taken hostage.

They couldn’t refuse his offer.

“I’ll depart immediately. I’ll also try to assess the hostages’ situation. I’ll leave the rest to you.”

“…We’ll mobilize all our resources. Be careful, Young Hero Ha. You are the future of the Murim.”

And so, with Grand Elder Zhuge Gunak’s words of encouragement, Hugo packed his belongings and left the Zhuge Clan estate.

Whoosh—

He leaped into the air, using his lightness skill, his figure disappearing into the night sky, a sense of determination filling his heart.

But that seriousness gradually faded as he left the mountain, his footsteps becoming lighter and more carefree.

‘I might as well practice my martial arts while I’m out here. Actual combat is the best way to improve one’s skills.’

He hummed a cheerful tune, his thoughts strangely at odds with the situation.

Of course, he had no intention of actually going to Beijing.

‘Let’s see… At this speed… It’ll take about a week? That’s quite a distance. Well, it should be over by the time I arrive.’

After all, there was someone else who was eagerly awaiting the discovery of their target’s location.

Someone who could handle things quickly, efficiently, and… cleanly.

The new landlord, who would hunt down the escaped tenants to the ends of the earth.

‘How long has it been?’

Zhuge Hyemi, staring blankly at the clear blue sky outside the window, closed her eyes tightly.

The weather, unlike her mood, was perfect.

‘I never thought I’d end up here.’

Beijing, the ruins of the imperial palace.

It was a demonic realm, a cursed land.

It drained the Ki from martial artists and sorcerers, preventing them from using their full power, and ordinary people withered and died after spending too much time there.

She knew why the Demonic Cult had brought her here.

‘A human sacrifice… I’m… a sacrifice…’

She was intelligent and perceptive, and during her time as their prisoner, she had easily figured out their motives, their desires, their plans.

They hadn’t even tried to hide it.

‘Well, it doesn’t matter anyway. I can’t escape.’

She was in a private room near the ruins of the palace.

There were no restraints, only a formation protecting her from the hostile environment… but no one, including herself, had even attempted to escape.

‘I’ll be captured the moment I step outside. And then they’ll treat me even worse.’

There were plenty of Demonic Cult warriors visible, and there were probably many more hidden in the shadows.

Perhaps even right outside her room.

“Sigh…”

She sighed softly, a habit she had developed during her captivity.

“…Ah, right. I have to exercise.”

A promise she had made with someone suddenly flashed through her mind.

They hadn’t known each other for long, but she couldn’t help but think of him whenever she was alone.

-“I’ll be training hard here, so please tell me all about it when you return, Young Master Ha. It’s a promise?”

She had been diligently exercising, trying to maintain her physical and mental strength, but her resolve was weakening.

She had managed to keep it up until yesterday…

‘…It doesn’t matter anymore. I won’t be able to hear his stories anyway.’

She was about to get up, then slumped back down, her energy drained.

She had been clinging to hope, but she had reached her limit.

The end was near.

‘…I wish I could see him one last time…’

And then,

“Huh?”

…She gasped softly, noticing a sudden change.

‘What’s that?’

Her gaze shifted towards the sky.

Rumble—

The clear, blue sky…

…was now covered in dark, ominous storm clouds.

As if foreshadowing something… unpleasant.
